You show us everything you've got
You keep on dancing and the room gets hot
You drive us wild, we'll drive you crazy
And you say you wanna go for a spin
The party's just begun, we'll let you in
You drive us wild, we'll drive you crazy

You keep on shouting, you keep on shouting

I wanna rock and roll all night
And party every day
I wanna rock and roll all night
And party every day
I wanna rock and roll all night
And party every day
I wanna rock and roll all night
And party every day

You keep on saying you'll be mine for a while
You're looking fancy and I like your style
And you drive us wild, we'll drive you crazy
And you show us everything you've got
Uh, baby, baby, that's quite a lot
And you drive us wild, we'll drive you crazy

You keep on shouting, you keep on shouting

I wanna rock and roll all night
And party every day
I wanna rock and roll all night
And party every day
I wanna rock and roll all night
And party every day
I wanna rock and roll all night
And party every day

I wanna rock and roll all night
And party every day
I wanna rock and roll all night
And party every day
I wanna rock and roll all night
And party every day
I wanna rock and roll all night
And party every day
